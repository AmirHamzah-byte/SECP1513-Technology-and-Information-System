# SECP1513-Technology-and-Information-System

This subject introduces students to the important role of technology in modern businesses and organizations.Throughout this course, I learned about the main components that make up an information system, such as hardware, software, data, people, and processes.The subject also exposed me to current trends like AI and Big Data, which are important for solving real-world problems, as we experienced during our MindEase project.

I studied subjects including Cloud Computing, AI & Big Data, Cybersecurity, Information System Components (Hardware, Software, Data, People, Processes), and practical uses of technology in corporate settings.
